# GoldPricePredictor

A Python project for predicting the price of gold (GLD) using machine learning techniques. The project is based on a dataset that includes various features such as S&P 500 index (SPX), crude oil prices (USO), silver prices (SLV), and EUR/USD exchange rates. The main goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict the future price of gold based on these features.

# Libraries used
NumPy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
sciklearn

# Procedure
Data Loading, Data Exploration, Data Visualization, Data Preprocessing, Model Training, Model Training

# Results
The trained machine learning model achieves an R-squared error of approximately 0.9894 on the test data, indicating that it can predict gold prices with high accuracy
